- must disconnect. 
- a constantly connected world, is a constantly distracted one. 
- want to be productive? go offline.
- What if certain content required us to disconnect?
- The way a message is delivered is important and informs the content.
- What makes a message influential: novelty, participation (participation is more than interaction, but deep interaction), relevance
- We forget that we have privilege: we can create a new culture
- digital literacy is rising
- it's almost exclusively read-only
- you're not a ninja, but a guttenburg. 
- democratization of media: Medium/Youtube/Bandcamp
- software enables democratization

# offline Tech
- detects connection status
- `navigator.onLine` -> online and offline events. Chrome on windows doesn't fire them. You can do polling however.
- `react-detect-offline` is a small library to test it for you. 
- make websites available offline. Do this with Service Workers. They work in the background and act as a proxy. 

- Open Graph is previews of things for social media. 

# reception
- front page of hacker news
- 10 language fork

- if you put something out there, expect bompliments and trolling. 
- be nice to these people, it will mess them up.
